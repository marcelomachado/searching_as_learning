Existing research has largely focused on observing how users with learning-oriented information needs behave and interact with search engines. What is not yet quantified is the extent to which search is a viable learning activity compared to instructor-designed learning. Can a search session be as effective as a lecture video'our instructor-designed learning artefact'for learning? To answer this question, we designed a user study that pits instructor-designed learning (a short high-quality video lecture as commonly found in online learning platforms) against three instances of search, specifically (i) single-user search, (ii) search as a support tool for instructor-designed learning, and, (iii) collaborative search. We measured the learning gains of 151 study participants in a vocabulary learning task and report three main results: (i) lecture video watching yields up to 24% higher learning gains than single-user search, (ii) collaborative search for learning does not lead to increased learning, and (iii) lecture video watching supported by search leads up to a 41% improvement in learning gains over instructor-designed learning without a subsequent search phase.<br/> &copy; 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",inproceedings,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271676,,,Knowledge management;Search engines;,,,English,Collaborative searches;High quality video;Higher learning;Human learning;Learning Activity;Online learning;Search sessions;Vocabulary learning;,,"43730,3","43732,2",marcelo.machado,,Duplicated,

While there is a large body of literature that compares print and digital reading, research that compares differently designed digital reading environments is limited. Such work can inform the design of information and search systems intended to support learning. This study investigated the effects of two design dimensions: Text Presentation (Plain Text vs In-Context) and Interactivity (availability of Reading Tools). Results show that the simplest textual environment (Plain Text presentation with no Interactivity) was associated with the highest comprehension outcomes, but that Interactivity mitigated the negative effects of texts presented In-Context. Both time spent reading and certain reading behaviours varied to some extent by condition and may be associated with comprehension; however, personal characteristics of the readers played little to no role in determining outcomes.<br/> &copy; 2016 Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals.",article,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0165551515614472,,,Information science;Information systems;,,1655515,English,Information interaction;Integration models;Interactivity;learning;reading;Text comprehensions;,,"43730,3","43730,3",marcelo.machado,,Unclassified,

We argue that enriching the knowledge-context in SERPs has great potential for facilitating human learning, critical thinking, and creativity by expanding searchers' information-literate actions such as comparing, evaluating, and differentiating between information sources. Thus it supports the development of learning-centric search systems. Using theories and empirical findings from psychology and the learning sciences, we first discuss general effects of Web search on memory and learning. After reviewing selected research addressing metacognition and self-regulated learning, we discuss design goals for search systems that support metacognitive skills required for long-term learning, creativity, and critical thinking. We then propose that SERPs make both bibliographic and inferential knowledge-context readily accessible to motivate and facilitate information-literate actions for learning and creative endeavors. A brief discussion of related ideas, designs, and prototypes found in prior work follows. We conclude the paper by presenting future research directions and questions on knowledge-context, information-literate actions, and learning-centric search systems.<br/> &copy; 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

To support learning from data on the web and facilitating learning through searching for data, the different characteristics of these sources need to be considered. Data usually needs additional context in order to be transformed into information and subsequently knowledge of an individual. Searching for data on the web requires a means to understand, analyse and interpret the data found. This can either be provided by the system; by the way context is presented; or by the user's prior knowledge of the topic and general data literacy skills.

First, the meaning of the concepts 'learning' and 'searching' is briefly defined. Learning is conceptualized as changes in one's knowledge structures. Then it is described more in detail how learning occurs in the search process. The point of departure is to focus on tasks that require the restructuring of knowledge structures and to analyse how gradual stabilization of those structures is related to accessing and interacting with information sources. After that, empirical studies on searching and learning are categorized by identifying independent and dependent variables in those studies. In conclusion, some general remarks on the topic are presented.<br/> &copy; 2016 Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals.",article,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0165551515615833,,,Information science;Information systems;,,1655515,English,Criteria of success;Information searching;Knowledge structures;learning;search outcome;,,"43730,3","43732,2",marcelo.machado,,Duplicated,

Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a longitudinal study for a three-month period on an actual task. The participants, who were undergraduate students, needed to write a research proposal in three months to apply for funding for a research project, including a three-hour experiment. Findings: The results show that undergraduates&rsquo; learning in the collaborative search process for academic group work included knowledge reconstruction, tuning, and assimilation. Their understanding of the topic concepts improved through the process, and their attitudes became more optimistic. Besides, the learning in the collaborative information search process also enhanced participants&rsquo; skills in communication, research, information search, and collaboration. To improve learning outcomes, professional and appropriate academic resources are required, as well as effective division of labor, positive sharing behaviors, and use of collaborative systems. Practical implications: The future development of collaborative information search systems should focus on the needs of academic research and support for elements such as instant communication and knowledge sharing. Originality/value: This paper contributes to research into searching as learning by understanding undergraduates&rsquo; collaborative search behavior for writing a proposal.<br/> &copy; 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",article,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/AJIM-03-2017-0063,,,Distributed computer systems;Information retrieval;Students;,,20503806,English,Collaborative information;Collaborative learning;Collaborative queries;Group learning;Information seeking behaviours;Searching as learning;,,"43730,3","43732,2",marcelo.machado,,Duplicated,

Existing studies on this topic usually measure the knowledge growth before and after a search. However, there still lacks a fine-grained understanding of users' knowledge change patterns within a search process and users' adoption of different sources for learning. In this on-going project, we are exploring answers to both questions in collaborative information seeking (CIS) since the CIS tasks are usually exploratory, which triggers learning, and involve diverse learning resources such as self-explored search content, partners' search content and explicit communication between them. Through analyzing the data from a controlled laboratory user study with both collaborative and individual information seeking conditions, we demonstrated that users' knowledge keeps growing in both conditions, but they issue significantly more diverse queries in the collaborative condition. Our analysis of users' queries also revealed that the adoption of different learning resources varies at different information seeking stages, and the adoption is influenced by the nature of search tasks too. Finally, we propose several insights for system design to enhance knowledge learning in collaborative information seeking process.<br/>",inproceedings,,,,,,,16130073,English,Collaborative information;Controlled laboratory user studies;Explicit communication;Information seeking;Knowledge growths;Knowledge learning;Learning resource;Searching as learning;,,"43730,3","43732,2",marcelo.machado,,Duplicated,

The paper begins by reviewing current literature that tends to characterize search systems as tools for learning. We then present a perspective on searching as learning that focuses on the learning that occurs during the search process, as well as search outputs and learning outcomes. The concept of 'comprehensive search' is proposed to describe iterative, reflective and integrative search sessions that facilitate critical and creative learning beyond receptive learning. We also discuss how search interaction data can provide a rich source of implicit and explicit features through which to assess search-related learning. In conclusion, we summarize opportunities and challenges for future research with respect to four agendas: developing a search system that supports sense-making and enhances learning; supporting effective user interaction for searching as learning; providing an inquiry-based literacy tool within a search system; and assessing learning from online searching behaviour.<br/> &copy; 2016 Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals.",article,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0165551515615841,,,Information science;Information systems;,,1655515,English,Assessment of learning in searching;Creative-learning;Implicit and explicit features;Learning outcome;Learning process;searching as learning;User interaction;Web-searching;,,"43730,3","43732,2",marcelo.machado,,Duplicated,
